# Chessperados

This is a windows application of a chess game built in Java and Java Swing by Rishik Raj and team members Saurav Sinha, Shivank, and Samir Chaudhary as part of our 4th semester project work.  The game can be played by two players by selecting their names and maximum time for each move. Players can select any piece from the chess board to move according to the rules of chess. As a player selects any piece, all the possible moves will be highlighted, and the player can move to any of the highlighted squares. The game will either be won by any of the players or will end in a draw because the king has no place to move.
